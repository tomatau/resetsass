Skeleton SASS
=============

Skeleton SASS is a "SASSification" of Dave Gamache's [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com) responsive front-end framework.

* `.scss` and `.sass` syntaxes available
* `compass` versions available
* Ability to seamlessly adjust grids
	* Fixed Grid (default)
	* Fluid Grid
	* Adjust columns and gutters
* Install Skeleton SASS with bower! `bower install skeleton-sass`
* [Live demo!](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/demo.html)
* [Extensive documentation](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki)

## TL;DR
Skeleton SASS is a SASS port of Skeleton CSS. Skeleton SASS is primarily written and debugged using the newer "SassyCSS" syntax of SASS which is seen via the `.scss` file extension. If you are familiar and/or prefer the older HAML-style syntax then fret not, we offer this syntax as well which is seen via the `.sass` file extension.

If you are new to SASS altogether then please read our [wiki](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki) for a more in-depth look at Skeleton SASS, information regarding installing ruby and SASS, and many other valuable resources!

If you have used Skeleton CSS and you are tired of dealing with vanilla CSS, then transitioning to Skeleton SASS will require minimal effort. Since Skeleton SASS is built to duplicate the file hierarchy of Skeleton CSS. This allows the transition to be smooth and painless.

If you have tried other SASS ports of Skeleton CSS you've probably seen a ports that are built inefficiently, inaccurately, and perhaps even downright poorly. Skeleton SASS will be the last time you search for a SASS port of Skeleton CSS. With only _three_ additional files to satisfy dependencies, this will allow you to easily transition into using Skeleton SASS. Continue reading about each of the files that are used by Skeleton SASS.

### Features
1. Duplicates the exact file hierarchy, file structure, and file names as Skeleton CSS
2. Separation of variables, functions, and mixins to keep code clean and **DRY**
3. Compass and Non-Compass versions available
4. `.sass` and `.scss` versions available
5. Install Skeleton SASS with bower front-end package manager

### Project Organization
Skeleton SASS is organized into **two** major categories:

1. [Compass Version](http://compass-style.org/)
2. Non-Compass Version

Both of these versions are organized the same exact way to ensure maximum usability:

* `bourbon`
	* `core`
		* Bourbon source files
	* `_loader.scss`
	* `_dependencies.scss`
	* `_mixins.scss`
	* `_functions.scss`
	* `_vars.scss`
	* `base.scss`
	* `layout.scss`
	*  `skeleton.scss`
* `compass` (Compass Version)
	* `sass`
		* `_dependencies.sass`
		* `_mixins.sass`
		* `_functions.sass`
		* `_vars.sass`
		* `base.sass`
		* `layout.sass`
		*  `skeleton.sass`
	* `scss`
		* `_dependencies.scss`
		* `_mixins.scss`
		* `_functions.scss`
		* `_vars.scss`
		* `base.scss`
		* `layout.scss`
		*  `skeleton.scss`
* `sass` (Non-Compass Version)
	* `sass` is the same as above
	* `scss` is the same as above

### File Overview
* `skeleton` contains the core of the framework. This file contains the  responsive goodness among other structural styles and is **required** for the framework to be used.
* `layout` is an _optional_ file where you can add custom styles that may extend the framework and/or custom styles for your website. You may discard this file if you wish.
* `base` is an _optional_ file which contains the default styles for the framework. You may discard this file if you wish.
* `_mixins` is a [partial file](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials) that contains all of the high-level core mixins used in the framework which means this file is **required**. Additionally, you may add your own custom mixins at the top of this file as well as edit existing mixins to suit your needs. See this file for additional information.
* `_dependencies` is a [partial file](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials) that contains core functions and "private" mixins that aren't meant to be used directly. Avoid editing this file directly unless you know what you're doing! The framework **will not work** if you delete this file.
* `_vars` is a [partial file](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials) which is **required** because it contains all of the global variables for the framework. See file for additional information.
* `_functions` is a [partial file](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#partials) where you may add custom functions. This file is **not required** by any means and may be discarded if you wish.

### Bower
> Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat &mdash; bower.io

For more info on bower, checkout [bower.io](http://bower.io/).

Skeleton Sass is now available on Bower because we want to make your life easier. You can now add Skeleton Sass to any project easily by issuing `bower install skeleton-sass`.

### Demo
Live demo can be seen here: [http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass). Be sure to resize your browser window and see the responsive goodness in action!

Want to see spin on the default 16-column fixed-grid system? See the [demo here](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/demo.html)!
